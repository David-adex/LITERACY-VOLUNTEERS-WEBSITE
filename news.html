            <p class="card-text">Since retirement I have been a Volunteer with Literacy Volunteers and
              never has my time been so well spent than my involvement with our
              worthwhile Charity, for all the reasons with which you are familiar.</p>
            <p class="card-text"><b>BUT</b> we need more of you! So this is a big ask for your help in
              introducing more folks like yourselves, who could hold our ethos which is
              <b>“make reading fun”</b> to heart and continue to help us in the amazing work
              we do.
            </p>
            <p class="card-text">We have priority areas where we need to recruit. Please check with your
              Area Co-ordinator where there is need, but any conversations with friends,
              colleagues, groups that you belong to would be really helpful. Placing
              advertisements in libraries, parish magazines or any regular local papers,
              leaflets that are available for this, would be hugely appreciated. We can
              supply you with the publicity for this.</p>
            <p class="card-text">You are the frontline of Literacy Volunteers and if all of you were able to
              recommend or recruit a new Volunteer each, it would be a job well done!</p>

              <p class="card-text">As we started the New Year and a new term, we had the new variant to cope with.
                Thankfully many of the Volunteers who had been in last term have been
                happy to go back into school. A few Volunteers who are clinically vulnerable are delaying their return but
                are hoping to be back in school very soon.</p>
              <p class="card-text">In school, Volunteers are carrying out lateral flow tests before going to school. They
                are wearing face coverings in school and schools have kept up the cleaning and hygiene procedures. All the
                procedures are agreed with the
                Volunteer and the school before a Volunteer starts or returns. Volunteers are happy to be back and the
                children are loving their sessions.</p>
              <p class="card-text">If you have any questions or concerns please get in touch with your Area Co-
                ordinator who will get back to you as soon as they can to help and support you.</p>

                <a class="link-light" href="https://www.gov.uk/coronavirus">https://www.gov.uk/coronavirus</a>) is as follows:
                You can stop self-isolating at the start of day 6 if you get 2 negative rapid lateral flow test results on
                days 5 and 6 and do not have a temperature. Tests
                must be at least 24 hours apart. If either test is positive, wait 24 hours before testing again.</p>

              <h5 class="card-title">Volunteer Profile—Barry Parker</h5>
              <p class="card-text">Firstly, just a little about me, for no other reason than it has a bearing
                on my motivation to become a Literacy Volunteer.</p>
              <p class="card-text">After eight years in the Armed Forces (Royal Marines) I spent most of the rest of my
                working life with
                BT, where I was lucky enough to complete, an OU BSc. based primarily in Psychology. When I was in my early
                teens, although I was a
                competent reader I did not read regularly, and it was only the encouragement of an older sister that
                converted me to becoming a
                lifelong reading advocate. I firmly believe that the gift of reading is the key to self-fulfilment, not
                just the acquisition of knowledge,
                but also its ability to free you from the here and now.</p>
              <p class="card-text">So, after retiring some years ago and casting around worthwhile projects I finally
                picked up some
                information about Literacy Volunteers and after training at a very difficult time through Covid I
                attended my first session at Mansfield Primary Academy, and to say it was inspirational is an
                understatement.</p>
              <p class="card-text">The school were clear that the children should not use Volunteers
                first names, so I asked to be called Mister Barry, in an attempt make it more friendly. After an
                introduction
                by the teacher to the class, to hear the whole of year one shout hello Mr Barry was heart-warming in the
                extreme. I have, more recently, reached agreement with each child that I see, to not say “I can’t read
                that” but to say, “I can’t read that
                yet”, which always seems to see me rewarded with a smile. They all appear to enjoy our sessions together
                and I have seen indications of improvement
                especially with “blending” and general confidence.</p>
              <p class="card-text">I do realise that I need to constantly consider better ways to reach these children,
                especially those who
                perhaps, do not get the support from home. For example, I’m considering asking them to tell me “why is it
                a good thing to be able to read well”</p>

                  sessions in October. It was
                  wonderful to see the families in person finally and meet some new ones too. There are two sessions
                  running weekly in Hyson Green and St Ann’s and we are sharing stories, ideas for parents/carers to help
                  support their child’s early literacy and reading
                  development and craft, songs and fun. We ran an outdoor storytelling session in St
                  Ann’s Community Orchard which was great fun and had really good feedback from the
                  families. We’re hoping to do another one in the Spring.</p>
